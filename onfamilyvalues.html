        Why do Democrats and the MSM endlessly target the traditional White American family and Christian faith? Because they know the foundation of a free society is built on these enduring institutions. <strong>You can't build communism until the institute of family collapses</strong>. Karl Marx saw this clearly when he pointed to the role of the family in sustaining private property, personal independence, and religious tradition. The family unit, bound by inheritance, entrepreneurship, and spiritual capital, stands as the final barrier against total ideological submission. It offers a structure that resists centralized control, and for that reason, it must be dismantled by those seeking absolute authority.<br />
        Think back to the country of Soviets. The first communist experiment ended in failure not due to theoretical flaws, but because they <strong>didn't destroy the family first</strong>. The state apparatus and the CPSU's Judeo-Bolshevist leadership made a sustained effort to fracture familial bonds and suppress religious customs, yet they couldn't erase those deep cultural roots quickly enough. Vladimir Lenin prioritized the construction of gulags and repression of dissent, but he ignored the Base of Western culture, which made the United States. That misstep allowed resistance to simmer within homes across the nation.<br />
        This time, the global regime is moving with greater precision. The strategy is methodical, and the goal is to prevent any source of independent moral order from surviving. The world government operates behind layers of obfuscation and soft-sounding slogans, but it is very real. It guides <strong>the world revolution</strong> by infiltrating language, bending words until they become weapons. Terms like <i>“equity,” “climate justice,” “democracy”</i> do not mean what people assume. They are meant to impose communist beliefs. The globalists want to dominate your entire existence. That includes your food, your movement, your relationships, and your inner thoughts. Their first move in achieving this level of control is to weaken the tradition until it breaks.<br />
        The Soviet Union did collapse in 1991, but it already sowed the seeds of communism in the West. The cultural Marxists who took over academia and media in the 1960s were the children of those who lived through the Soviet era. They learned from their parents' mistakes and adapted their tactics. Instead of outright revolution, they chose a slow, insidious infiltration of Western institutions. They understood that to change a society, you must first change its culture. Which is why they endorse mass immigration and stuff too.
